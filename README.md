# Simple MLP Network to solve a Blood Pressure Estimation Regression Problem
A simple regression MLP Network using MATLAB and Python (w/ PyTorch). The network has one hidden layer and an output layer,
both using the hyperbolic tangent as activation function. The number of neurons in the hidden layer
can be altered within the program. The number of inputs and the learning rate can also be altered.

The network was originally designed for a regression task using a blood pressure estimation dataset, which can be
found @ https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cuff-Less+Blood+Pressure+Estimation#.

This project is a part of my scientific initiation studies with professor Romis Attux, at the State University of Campinas.
